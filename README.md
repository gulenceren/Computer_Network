Knowledge of octet and CIDR;
    1- A program that writes the octets of the given IP address.
    2- Program that calculates the network address with the given IP address and CIDR information.

Number of Machines and Subnets;
    Part A:
        1-enter the number of machines that should be in the subnet
        2- If a number does not follow the 2^n rule, it is completed to the nearest 2^n.
        3- a program that displays the network address, broadcast address and ip pool on subnets.

    Part B:
        1-The number of subnets should be entered as input.
        2-Accordingly, the program that displays the network address, broadcast address and ip pool in the subnets.

Checksum Algorithm;
    The checksum algorithm program that tests that the data information entered from the console (Sender) -> Receiver is correct.

Knowledge of octet and CIDR;
   1)By encoding the 32-bit data received as hexadecimal with CRC-8
        a-)Provision is made
        b-)If a bit is randomly corrupted, this codeword is checked to see if it is correct.
    2)
        a-)Hamming (0x57ACEFA) takes 28-bit data from the user, converts it to binary, adds redundancies according to its length and generates the codeword.
        b-)A random bit is considered corrupt and the corrupt bit is said
